### Personal project boilerplate for go restful api server.
Based on Chi mux https://github.com/go-chi
additional:
- Request Validator: https://github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
- CORS: https://github.com/rs/cors
- Config Parser: https://github.com/spf13/viper
- Docs: https://github.com/swaggo/http-swagger
- Secure Middleware: https://github.com/unrolled/secure

Used most of the time for Layered Archi, probably suitable too for DDD. I'm not going to write any documentation, so if you want to use this, go play around and find out!
