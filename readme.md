### Personal project boilerplate for go restful api server.
Based on Chi mux https://github.com/go-chi
additional:
- Request Validator: github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
- CORS: github.com/rs/cors
- Config Parser: github.com/spf13/viper
- Docs: github.com/swaggo/http-swagger
- Secure Middleware: github.com/unrolled/secure

Used most of the time for Layered Archi, probably suitable too for DDD.
